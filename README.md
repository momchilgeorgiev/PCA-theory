 During my course in data science I had the pleasure to work on a short project about PCA. I wanted to share what I have done and perhaps "shine a little light" on the subject while giving my own spin. 

This notebook is mainly designed for people who have **just started** studying programming and data science. I have tried to explain everything as simple as I can and if it gets technical - there are always sources to read that explain it in more detail.

With that out of the way. Enjoy!
